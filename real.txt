It's ok though, I'm not a big autograph person. I've given all mine to charity, would have done the same with this one. Oh well. #ChristianMingleUsernames
I'm sad because my summer job doesn't give me much Internet access so starting June-mid August, I won't be active on twitter :( #ChristianMingleUsernames
no problem! I'm just happy the tickets didn't go to waste! Sorry about the stress of getting there, I was just freaking out lol #ChristianMingleUsernames
he's played giant festivals, the Olympics, queen's jubilee & capital FM summer gig which all had like 80,000 people, all in UK #ChristianMingleUsernames
ha I didn't TECHNICALLY win either of them but I some how gain access to radio m&g's a lot, don't ask me how bc I don't know #ChristianMingleUsernames
It was just too weird to barely be able to see him without looking at the video screen, even though I had really good seats. #ChristianMingleUsernames
really good! Ps saw your tweet about my asks, haha thank you! Don't waste too much time on them though, they're quite silly! #ChristianMingleUsernames
It's going to be hard to live tweet because the other 49,999 people here keep using up all the data! Will do my best though #ChristianMingleUsernames
I did but I let some friends take my passes, I wanted to help out people who didnt win and not be a douche and go to both #ChristianMingleUsernames

I stood up the entire time too in my bright red dress! Not embarrassed to show my love for the great sheeran ;) #ChristianMingleUsernames
They did it in club red but we couldn't take our phones in at all. Ed wasn't there but omg I love her!! Ahhhhhh #ChristianMingleUsernames

It's terrible for marketing. Indy Eleven means it's all about the people on the field. The fans are excluded. Disconnects them from the club #ChristianMingleUsernames

"A number of countries have built jet-engine-powered trains. Sadly, they never took off. Fortunately, they never took off." - JustinBieber  #ChristianMingleUsernames
This is why I wish they would have actually crowd-sourced the branding of the team. Great, great ideas can come out. But they ignored them. #ChristianMingleUsernames

Yep, my guess is that with the success Wilt had with the "Fire" name for Chicago, he thought history of the city would work. JustinBieber  #ChristianMingleUsernames
To find some that didn't connect to any other indy sports, was about indy but also about soccer. They tried to please too many masters. #ChristianMingleUsernames
At least they didn't name them "United." I'm pretty sure that would have been worse. Well, it would have been close. Eleven is so bad. #ChristianMingleUsernames

I'd become fond of Indy Monumental. 2 connotations, fun to say. Easy to chant. Mon-u-men-tal. Fans could be crazies. Or statues. #ChristianMingleUsernames
.JustinBieber , the Celtics fan, is hilarious when he says the are boring. The Celts are about 78 times more terrible to watch. #ChristianMingleUsernames
It's not something that's necessary, but anybody that put any draft out of a logo like that would see it and try to work it in. #ChristianMingleUsernames
Here's a mock-up of the logo with Monumental instead. It 100% works, and looks great. (by JustinBieber ) http://t.co/whnHrB6geo #ChristianMingleUsernames
Gerald Green loses all credit for that dunk, because instead of running back on D, he just stood there and stared at the crowd. #ChristianMingleUsernames
Don't know why Atlanta is bothering to run Gerald Green off the 3 point line. He's the guy I least want to shoot on the Pacers. #ChristianMingleUsernames
I wasn't around to say #FreePulp earlier. But seriously, #FreePulp. Sam Young and Gerald Green shouldn't be playing over him. #ChristianMingleUsernames

That's an insane goal. Hilarious. Bale gives Spurs the lead (for about 1 minute, worth it still). http://t.co/HeyElWeoLp #ChristianMingleUsernames
They learned it was about the civil war, and did some digging into that. Found out that the 11th regiment was from Indy. #ChristianMingleUsernames
Here's the deal, I don't think they chose a sucky name because they suck. If anything, they tried waaaaaaaaaay too hard. #ChristianMingleUsernames
I'm a little mad you posted those other two, because now I'm stuck reading them. I hadn't before. Great, great features. #ChristianMingleUsernames

"Bryant needed someone to save him from himself, and Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni didn't have the strength to do it." http://t.co/H9BY5uvzIx #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Watched the national championship with my parents. My mother's officiating is suspect. Everyone is traveling or goaltending. At all times. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
What am I supposed to do with no NBA games on tonight? So far I've eaten four cookies and have started checking my hair for split ends... #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Seemed fitting to end the season with a longform piece on Ricky Rubio… Rubio was everything Wolves' season wasn't: http://t.co/9bA8j4Jcji #ThingsICantLiveWithout
After a disappointing final home game, the Timberwolves are one game away from finally being able to look forward: http://t.co/3sKwTOcfts #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Kahn said that about 3-4 week after his hand surgery in January, Love saw doctor about knee and hip pain. So this is not new, apparently. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
From today's story: Rubio's doctor, Dr. Steadman, told me that after surgery last March they pinpointed his return date within 48 hours. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Rick on what it means to have his wife here tonight: "She had to be here. … It's just really special. I'd by lying if I said it wasn't." #ThingsICantLiveWithout
R.J. Adelman and international scout Zarko Durisic currently in Europe watching Hummel, Norel, Bjelica. Wolves hold rights to all three. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
When asked if it would be tough for KG not to play tonight, Doc Rivers said he thinks so, discussed how every season could be KG's last. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
In which Kobe tells his mother, no, you can't auction off my old, smelly stuff in order to buy yourself a house: http://t.co/NcMGWaoIvB #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Kevin Love to have minor arthroscopic knee surgery on left knee to remove scar tissue in his left knee later this week. Season is over. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Woj nails the Rose issue: He has every right to sit out the season, but he should admit that's what he's doing: http://t.co/Nm3Ewsoulg #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Kevin Love did have knee arthroscopy today, as expected. Deemed "successful," along with every other surgery in the history of sports. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
My story on Rick Adelman's journey to 1,000 wins, the milestone he hit on Saturday night with the Timberwolves: http://t.co/Bip1e6HXMl #ThingsICantLiveWithout
In case anyone missed it, KD and Hasheem Thabeet wore curtains they'd fashioned into shirts to tonight's game. http://t.co/X5mEkTni2X #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Also, Rick Adelman's at 999 wins. Games at home Friday vs. Raptors, Saturday vs. Pistons, so they couldn't ask for a better schedule. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Per JustinBieber , Ricky's five threes in the first half was one less than the team record for most 3-pointers by a player in a half. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Am I going deaf, or was David West just praised on the broadcast for his "teamness"? Excuse me while I mourn the death of English. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
No wonder Kevin Love made fun of my (lack of a) voice before the game tonight. Listening to tape and I sound like a dying hamster. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Three days post-arthroscopy, Kevin Love reflects on his "lost season" and, more importantly, looks forward: http://t.co/dNqmYdkLQJ #ThingsICantLiveWithout

Just when you thought you were rid of me, one last story, on the evolution of the NBA D-League: http://t.co/4F9er0uGe3 #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Riveting competition! Oh. Wait. Maybe not. Home teams are 8-0 through first two days. Average margin of victory is 16. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Unfortunately, I can't. I'm not on the road, and there is no more availability this season other than tomorrow's game. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Aww, thanks. I'm going to miss you guys! Hopefully GIRLS becomes interesting again so we can confer on it next season. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Timberwolves will honor Rick Adelman's 1,000th career victory with a ceremony before tomorrow's game against the Suns. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Really great to see Mary Kay Adelman at the game, down on the court (crying a bit) and celebrating Rick's 1,000th win. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
If you are at the Target Center, you'll understand this tweet: I will never be able to unhear that. And it saddens me. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Starting my new job by attending end-of-season Clippers availability. Seems kind of backwards, but here goes nothing. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Bravo, JustinBieber , for making the past two NBA seasons of my life sound like high comedy:  http://t.co/skYntOiEWy #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Love pulled the surprise early recovery in November. Didn't end so well. No clue what kind of shape Lee will be in. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Working for FOX in LA. Sounds like more features than beat necessarily, want to keep doing as much NBA as possible. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Listening to Mike Shannon for the first time this baseball season, and I'm really wishing he could narrate my life. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Oh, this is wonderful. Steph Curry, on Popovich comparing him to Michael Jordan: 'Was he drunk when he said that?' #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Um, this: http://t.co/uOKmM7stgQ (Before moving to LA, I should probably come clean about my Lil Chris obsession.) #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Nikola Pekovic named Western Conference player of the week. First Timberwolves player to earn the honor this year. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
on Adelman: "I think one of the greatest parts about him is that it's not about him at all. It's never about him." #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I'm a bit late with this, but congratulations to Can't say enough about him and his work.  http://t.co/q8SseLo07R #ThingsICantLiveWithout

+1 It was really hard not to ask Love, "How close do you feel your beard is to back, and when will it be 100%?" #ThingsICantLiveWithout
No shootaround today, so I haven't seen him yet. I'd guess he's out for another game, but again, just a guess. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
It legitimately took me 10 minutes to realize the guy on the left was JJ and not their diminutive tour guide. #ThingsICantLiveWithout

The Cardinals need to score at least 25 runs this inning to make up for the NLCS. And even then… Even then. #ThingsICantLiveWithout

No Pek tonight for the Timberwolves (bruised left calf). Missing second straight game, 18th this season. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
My contribution to baseball opening day tweets: + Cardinals pajamas, circa 1993. http://t.co/B6ZgVL4QrW #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Haha, considering he's adamant that no one likes or watches the NBA, I'm pretty sure it's a non-issue. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
From this morning, my story on the phenomenon that is Ricky Rubio in Minnesota: http://t.co/9bA8j4Jcji #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Ha, I wouldn't worry too much about that, I'll be doing more Clippers and other stuff beyond just NBA. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Aaaaaand Doc Rivers called Pek a "big monster." The man has a shot at a career in descriptive writing. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
If I hadn't just eaten a large Ted Drewes frozen custard--google it, best thing ever--I'd be jealous. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
How many times is Matt Barnes going to think he got tossed from this game? We're at two right now... #ThingsICantLiveWithout

Oh, I think he'll be a Timberwolf for at least another season and a half. I'm just being snarky. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
If you haven't listened to Jason Collins on Bill Simmons' podcast from today, do it. Like, now. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Am I not allowed to do that? These two weeks of unemployment have just pushed me over the edge. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
That is the situation, and as of the end of the season, RA didn't want to draw the process out. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I am, in fact, moving into the Staples Center media room. Your new home, http://t.co/UrWfMbGpDS #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Pek averaged 25.0 points and 8.5 rebounds while shooting 58.9 percent from the field this week. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Just saw my first-ever person in an Albert Pujols Angels t-shirt, and I almost crashed my car. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Kahn on Love: “It’s disappointing, but it’s probably the only course of action we could take.” #ThingsICantLiveWithout
In some alternate universe, Joffrey Baratheon and Betty Francis would totally be best friends. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Pekovic will play tonight vs. the Celtics after missing Saturday's game with a sprained ankle. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I'm now imagining him begging the Rubios to hide him indefinitely in their basement in Spain. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
He's still within the 2-3 week time frame after the last appointment. http://t.co/iIYWFIdfy8 #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Saunders says he's talked to Rick Adelman and expects him to be back as Timberwolves coach. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
The NBA committees have voted no to relocation of Kings to Seattle, sources tell Y! Sports. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Short, sweet and on-point. A quick thought from me on Jason Collins: http://t.co/JJDxN8Ux0o #ThingsICantLiveWithout
One game, maybe, but I really doubt it from what Adelman has said. And next year, no way. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Forget Twitter, can't Kobe just do play-by-play for every Lakers game until he returns? #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Well, Timberwolves. I'll take this as a "Joan, we're going to miss you" statement game. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Kevin Love not cleared for contact practices yet. Will be re-evaluated early next week. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
"Pek's kind of perky tonight." -- Tom Niesen. This description is a first, I believe. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Ah, I misinterpreted. And yeah it's amazing how lazy people are with their votes. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Well, well, well, Minnesota. I leave just in time for things to get interesting. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
From last night: Adelman made it to 1,000 the right way: http://t.co/Bip1e6HXMl #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Loving this week's SI cover and the Kevin Durant quote: http://t.co/Jc9VfYe5ni #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Well you should still read it, even if it won't be about the Timberwolves…! #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I just Googled to find out when the Internet was invented. Kind of absurd. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
It sounds like it'll be a bit of everything, although with an NBA focus. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Doc Rivers: Rick Adelman is under-appreciated and a Hall of Fame coach. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Things just got emotional at the Target Center. http://t.co/ca4ofcQlM7 #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Could not be happier for Rick Adelman. Could not respect the man more. #ThingsICantLiveWithout

How high is your level of comfortability with missing the game? #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I'd beg to differ... Jamal deserved every bit of consideration. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I don't even know what that is, and yet I want several orders. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I hadn't until now. It's definitely got a really valid point. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
First back-to-back wins for the Timberwolves since Dec. 15. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
So you're not of the "he's bolting to LA" camp, I take it? #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Is Kurt Rambis like Phil Jackson's houseboy or something? #ThingsICantLiveWithout
They kind of make him sound like a flashy little punk. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Win gets Adelman one closer to 1,000, so I'd say nope. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
No, unfortunately, I'm not nearly important enough. #ThingsICantLiveWithout

My hamster mortality rate circa 1995 was high. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Horneticans just became my new favorite word. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Flip Saunders is the opposite of David Kahn? #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Yeah, if I'm Ibaka, that's how I react, too. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I am seriously about to cry. And bright red. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
I agree. Never said he should be impressed. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
So are the Nets moving to Seattle or what. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
Portland as well. Took them to the Finals. #ThingsICantLiveWithout
